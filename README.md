# OT-WORK
1. a) Discuss any four issues that Israel got involved in that displeased God and caused Him to raise prophets to warn them.
b) If one of such prophets were to address the issues in your nation or community, which ones would he address? You may give relevant examples in your answer.
ANSWERS
Based on biblical accounts, the following are four issues that Israel got involved in that displeased God and led Him to raise prophets to warn them:
1.	Idolatry
Israel often turned to worship other gods and idols instead of the one true God. Examples include the worship of Baal during the time of Elijah and the story of the golden calf.
2.	Social Injustice and Oppression of the Needy
Israel was warned about mistreating vulnerable people such as the poor, widows, and orphans. Prophets like Amos spoke against the exploitation of the needy and the lack of justice in society.
3.	Disobedience to God’s Laws
Israel frequently failed to follow God’s commandments and statutes. This disobedience led to warnings from prophets such as Hosea and Jeremiah about the consequences of their actions.
4.	Reliance on Human Strength Instead of God
Israel sometimes placed trust in military alliances or foreign powers rather than depending on God for protection. Prophets like Isaiah warned against this misplaced trust.
Application to Modern Context (Uganda)
If a prophet like Isaiah were to address issues in Uganda or a community in Uganda a nation facing diverse challenges such as poverty, corruption, and religious diversity he might focus on issues like:
Corruption and Injustice, Prophets warning against injustice would address leaders about integrity in government and institutions, emphasizing fairness in the treatment of citizens.
Poverty and inequality, Addressing the gaps between the rich and the poor through urging care for the the vulnerable like widows and orphans for example providing them with food, clothes, shelter among others hence improving on their social wellbeing.
Interfaith and community relations, Encouraging harmony and respect among different religious and ethnic group and care for community highlighting the importance of community cohesion in Uganda.
Trust in God, Emphasing trust in God amidst challenges like poverty, security issues and development struggles in Uganda.
In conclusion, Israel’s history shows that involvement in issues like idolatry, social injustices, disobedience to God's laws, and reliance on human alliances rather than trust in one God led to divine displeasure and prophetic similarly in a context like Uganda's addressing pressing issues such as corruption, poverty, community relations and emphasing local values could be crucial for community well-being. Prophets as messengers of God play a role in highlighting these issues to guide communities towards positive change.
